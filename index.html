      <h1>Education summary</h1>
      <p>I attended Msgr. McClancy Memorial High School for four years. I took some AP courses, honors courses, and was part of the college advantage program, which allowed me to have some credits coming into St. John's. I eventually graduated Magna Cum Laude due to my GPA. From there, I decided to attend St. John's university, and am now studying for my Computer Science Bachelor's. This is technically my third year, but due to the credits I recieved from highschool, I will graduate a year earlier. I am hoping to graduate soon with my bachelor's degree, and eventually pursue my Master's Degree.</p>

      <p>I usually spend my time off playing video games or watching movies. I occasionally play chess with my friends or family. I have knowledge of the Linux kernel and have converted a few computers after the release of Windows 11; I have also managed to create a home server that keeps my family's files in a safe place.</p>
