      <h1 id="Education summary">Education summary</h1>
      <p>I attended Msgr. McClancy Memorial High School for 4 years and graduated in 2019. I took some AP and honors courses and was part of the college advantage program, which allowed me to earn some credits before coming to St. John's. I eventually graduated Magna Cum Laude due to my GPA. From there, I decided to attend St. John's University, and am now studying for my Computer Science Bachelor's. This is technically my third year, but because of the credits I earned in high school, I will graduate a year earlier. I am hoping to graduate soon with my bachelor's degree, and eventually pursue my Master's Degree.</p>

      <p>I usually spend my time off playing video games or watching movies. I occasionally play chess with my friends or family. I have knowledge of the Linux kernel and have converted a few computers after the release of Windows 11; I have also managed to create a home server that keeps my family's files in a safe place.</p>

      <p>In this project, we were tasked with creating and deploying our first HTML website through GitHub. The webpage required certain sections with information, such as basic profile information, your education, work experience, programming skills, general interests, favorite media (such as songs, films, and TV shows), favorite websites, and a menu that navigates those sections.</p>
